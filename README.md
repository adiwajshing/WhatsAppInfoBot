# WhatsappInfoBot - A framework to build bots generally, but specifically on WhatsApp. 

It uses [natural](https://github.com/NaturalNode/natural) (implemented by [@actuallysoham](https://github.com/actuallysoham)) to perform the natural language processing part & [Baileys](https://github.com/adiwajshing/Baileys) to interact with WhatsApp.

## Install

Install using npm: ` npm install github:adiwajshing/WhatsappInfoBot `

## Building Intents

The library follows a modular design. Every intent must be placed in separate files & in a single folder. So, you will have an `intents/` directory and in there a collection of intents that are either programmatic `.js` files or `.json` files. 

For example, a simple intent to answer queries about timings could look look like this:

[`timings.json`](/Example/intents/timings.json)
``` javascript
{
    "keywords": ["timings","time","when","timing","schedule","open","close"], // the keywords to identify an intent
    "answer": "*Timings for <entity:key> are:*\n <entity:value>", // the answer for this intent
    "entities": { // list of things the bot can answer for the `timings` intent
        "piano room": "6:00AM-12:00AM",
        "lunch": "12:15PM-02:30PM",
        "breakfast": "08:00AM-10:30AM",
        "snacks": "04:45PM-06:15PM",
        "dinner": "07:30PM-10:15PM",
        "laundry": "dropoff: Mon & Thu 08:00AM-02:00PM\npickup: Wed & Sat 04:30PM-06:00PM",
        "library": "all the time fren, except friday",
        "salon": {
            "alternates": ["parlour", "parlor", "saloon"], // alternate names for the same entity
            "value": "11:00AM-7:00PM, closed on tuesdays"
        },
        "asg": "shuts at 11:30PM"
    },
    "meta": { // some optional metadata to maybe create user facing documentation, see Example/intents/help.js
        "userFacingName": ["timings"],
        "description": "Timings for facilities",
        "examples": ["mail room timings", "timing 4 dinner", "yo bro, when can i get lunch"]
    }
}
```

So, if somebody asks the bot *ayy, till when does the parlour stay open?*, the bot will reply with:
    ```
    Timings for salon:
    11:00AM-7:00PM, closed on tuesdays
    ```

Here, `<entity:key>` maps onto the key, `salon` & `<entity:value>` maps onto the value, `11:00AM-7:00PM, closed on tuesdays`.
Moreover, because `parlour` is an alternate name for *salon*, the library maps `parlour` back to the true name `salon` and then responds.

Sometimes, statically typing intents like this is too much of a pain or impossible to do. What if one wants to fetch the weather? Then, one could use a js class to describe the intent.

For example, `weather.js` could look like the following:

``` javascript

module.exports = class {
    constructor (processor) {
        this.processor = processor // the instance of LanguageProcessor.js that created this instance
        this.keywords = ["weather", "like"] // keywords to identify the intent
        this.entities = {} // leave empty for now, you can fetch city names later and update the entities
        this.meta = { // set some metadata
            "userFacingName": ["weather"],
            "description": "Ask about the weather in different cities",
            "examples": ["weather in SF?", "new york weather", "listen fren, you better tell me what its like in Bombay"]
        }
        fetchCities ()
    }
    async fetchCities () {
        // fetch the cities you can answer for, possibly using a REST API
        // fetch weather.com/rest or something
        // then call this function to finally update the entities, you can leave the values blank because the answer will be fetched
        updateEntities ("weather", {"new york": "", "sf": "", "new delhi": "", "tokyo": ""}) 
    }
    /**
     * Async function that is called when somebody calls the `weather` command
     * @param {string[]} entities - what city?
     * @param {string} user - ID of the user
     */
    async answer (entities, user) {
        // fetch the cities you can answer for, possibly using a REST API
        // fetch weather.com/rest or something
        return "lol I dont know"
    }
}

```

## Usage:

1. Populate your intents folder with the intents you built. See this [example folder](/Example) for reference.
2. To simply test your intents out in terminal, see [here](/Example/chat.js):
    ``` javascript
    const LanguageProcessor = require('WhatsAppInfoBot/LanguageProcessor.js')
    const processor = new LanguageProcessor("./path/to/intents/", {parsingFailedText: "Oh no, I could not understand <input>"})
    processor.chat() // chat in terminal
    ```
2. To run your bot on WhatsApp, see [here](/Example/index.js): 
    ``` javascript
        const LanguageProcessor = require("WhatsAppInfoBot/LanguageProcessor.js")
        const WhatsAppResponder = require("WhatsAppInfoBot/Responder.js")

        const metadata = {
            parsingFailedText: "Oh no, I could not understand <input>", // what to say when the bot failed to understand what was being said
            admins: [ // admins of this bot, optional, is used for the help.js intent
                "23123123123",
                "12123123123"
            ],
            maxRequestsPerSecond: 0.33, // max requests a user can make in a second
            respondToPendingMessages: false,
            authFile: "./Example/auth_info.json" // path to the file where the WhatsApp credentials will be stored
        }
        const processor = new LanguageProcessor("./Example/intents/", metadata) // create the processor
        new Responder (processor.output, metadata).start () // start the WhatsApp Responder
    ```
    The first time you run the bot on WhatsApp, you will have to scan the QR (important: use a dark background in your shell when run the project) code to enable WhatsApp Web.
    Once you run this code, the responder will now connect to WhatsApp & it'll print out a QR code for you to scan with WhatsApp on your phone. 
    Once you scan it with your phone, the bot will start recieving & responding to messages.
    
    **Note:** the bot will try & respond to all unread messages on your WhatsApp.
